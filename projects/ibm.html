            <h1>WEX Placement @ IBM</h1>
            <h2>July 2024</h2>

            <p>
                In July of 2024, I was privilged to work for one week at IBM's Research and Development laboratory in
                Hursley, United Kingdom as part of a work experience placement.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                Over the course of my week, I was given my own office and projects to work on. One project included
                learning to setup a piece of in-house software on a Virtual Machine
                and also testing documentation.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                I was at the Hursley campus 9-5 every day for a week, where I also learned lots about life in the
                office.
