            <h1>Founder @ Cade</h1>
            <h2>2022-2023</h2>

            <p>
                I created Cade in 2022 as a free and easy to use website builder for small businesses and individuals.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                Cade allowed for users to either create a professional website where they could customise every picture
                and text from a range of templates,
                for them to download completely free and host themselves.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                Cade also allowed for uses who didn't want to host themselves and create a basic landing page with a
                photo, social links, name and description with only
                a small watermark available to be hosted for free on Cade.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                I wrote all the code for Cade myself. It ran on a PHP backend and a MySQL database. I hosted it on an
                Ubuntu VM hosted by Fasthosts.
